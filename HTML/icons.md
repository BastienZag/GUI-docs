		This library of icons is intended for use across all of our brands and user interfaces. They are designed to aid navigation and legibility. The use of icons
		purely as page embellishment is not recommended and in some cases will be off brand.
		These icons are implemented as scalable vector graphics (SVG&rsquo;s) with png fallback’s for older browsers. Using SVG’s ensures the highest quality rendering on
		all devices, allows us to style the icons using code and also complies with AA accessibility requirements.
