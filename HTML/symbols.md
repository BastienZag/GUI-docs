		These symbols are commonly used in [Brand] user interfaces. They are implemented as scalable vector graphics (SVG&rsquo;s) with png fallback&rsquo;s
		for older browsers. Using SVG&rsquo;s ensures the highest quality rendering on all devices, allows us to style the symbols using code and also complies
