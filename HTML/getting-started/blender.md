		<h2 class="body-font">What is the Blender?</h2>
		<p class="lead">
			The Blender is a tool that lets you mix the modules you need and leaves out the ones you don&rsquo;t.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="col-sm-7 col-sm-offset-2">
		<h3 class="body-font">Why do I have to choose?</h3>
		<p class="content-text">
			Having the ability to choose which modules are relevant to your project means less overhead for your users, less stress for you when it comes to
			performance testing and less things that could go wrong. The less modules you choose, the smaller the footprint on your network, the faster the user
			experience for your users.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="col-sm-7 col-sm-offset-2">
		<h3 class="body-font">What happens if I choose the wrong module(s) or I've changed my mind?</h3>
		<p class="content-text">
			Don&rsquo;t worry, the blender got you covered. Each module you chose will be saved into the localStorage of your browser so when you return the same
			selection will be waiting for you. But we know you may want to change computers or haven&rsquo;t been on the GUI site for a while so each download comes
			with a unique URL that saves all of your selected modules in their versions. Just have a look at the index page included in each download.<br>
			In case you deleted this one or don&rsquo;t have it handy, look into your CSS or JS file. Both have the URL hardcoded into the very top of the file
			inside a comment. Following this URL will bring you to the Blender with the very same selection of modules. You can now make adjustments and
			assess the impact on your project.
		</p>

	<div class="col-sm-7 col-sm-offset-2">
		<h3 class="body-font">What benefits do I get from using the GUI this way?</h3>
		<p class="content-text">
			Apart from the smaller footprint to your network, you are now also less effected by changes to modules that are not relevant to you. In the previous
			version of the GUI you had to install the newest version of the theme even though there may have been only changes to modules that you don&rsquo;t even
			use.<br>
			You also now have more control over what it is you&rsquo;re downloading. You have options to include LESS or unminified JS and tap right into the guts
			of it all.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="col-sm-7 col-sm-offset-2">
		<h3 class="body-font">What if I don&rsquo;t know what to choose?</h3>
		<p class="content-text">
			That&rsquo;s OK, We all start from the beginning. Try to choose as fewer as possible and grow over time. We often feel like just choosing everything and
			removing later but reality gets into the way and we forget to remove and then our user end up downloading more than they need.<br>
			Have a look at the example pages and decide together with Designer, UXer and Developer what you probably need for your project and go from there.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="col-sm-7 col-sm-offset-2">
		<h3 class="body-font">What&rsquo;s in the download?</h3>
		<p class="content-text">
			The zip file that you download contains, at a minimum, the production ready asset files and an index.html page that has all of them installed
			and explained. You can choose whether you want to include LESS and/or unminified JS files. That is handy if you want to extent on GUI.<br>
			<em>Remember though you want to stay upgradable in case we fix a couple bugs you don&rsquo;t want to double up on. Make sure you don&rsquo;t edit any of
			the files but use them and extend on them.</em>
