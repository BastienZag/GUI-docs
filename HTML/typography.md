		The typography system caters for our multi-brand framework allowing us to implement brand specific web typography. Due to licensing issues we currently
		don&rsquo;t use many brand specific web fonts however we&rsquo;re hoping to resolve this soon. The system will then help us implement brand specific fonts
		very easily.<br>
		<strong>Never use a web font without confirmation that you have the correct licence agreement in place.</strong>
