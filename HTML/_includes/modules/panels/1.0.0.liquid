		it would twist itself round and look up in her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing: and when she had got
		its head down, and was going to begin again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away:
		besides all this, there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were
		always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.
