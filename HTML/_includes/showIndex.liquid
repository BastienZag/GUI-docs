			This GUI is an HTML framework designed for multi-brand, responsive, mobile first projects. It provides HTML, CSS, LESS and JavaScript to describe how
			all the core interface elements should look and behave. The GUI can also be used as a point of reference for UX and UI designers. We&rsquo;re
			continually refining and optimising the GUI, adding elements and components as the UI evolves.

					<div class="index-faq-content-wrapper">

					<div class="index-faq-content-wrapper">
						<p>
							Our current browser support philosophy recommends one version forward and two versions back with the exception of the SOE.
						</p>
						<p>
							The GUI uses progressive enhancement therefore older browsers may render interface elements less optimally however they must still
							support the following:
						</p>
						<ul class="lists">
							<li>Enable the user to complete a task</li>
							<li>Meet standard usability guidelines</li>
							<li>
								Comply to WCAG2 AA accessibility guidelines
								<p>This position takes into consideration:</p>
								<ul class="lists">
									<li>
										Weighing up the ROI of tweaking for older browsers whose usage is declining not growing, for small enhancements which add no
										additional value to the experience or completion of a task e.g. rounded corners etc.
									</li>
									<li>Simplifying code by minimising styling with anything other than CSS</li>
									<li>Less dependancy on visual designers to provide graphic assets and support</li>
									<li>More efficient workflow when building interfaces intended for multi-brand</li>
									<li>Future proofing the quality of graphics when displayed on high definition screens</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							Interface rending concerns in older browsers can be raised to CX but ultimately the AFS Digital Brand Director will decide if the brand
							presentation is acceptable or if an alternative must be explored

						When you download an instance of the GUI and use it in your project you are responsible for testing and bug fixes. If you notice any bugs with the

						Even better... send in a <a href="https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-source/" target="_blank">pull request</a>. We&rsquo;d be very grateful.

				<div id="FAQ-q4" class="collapsible-body index-faq-content" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1">
					<div class="index-faq-content-wrapper">
						Yes. Every project no matter how small should have a UX designer and a UI designer. This will ensure that the interaction design and interface

					<div class="index-faq-content-wrapper">
						We do not recommend changing the files. To alter or add styles in your project please use an override css file and concatenate it at the bottom.
						This way you stay upgradeable in case we fix things and create a new version of a module.

					<div class="index-faq-content-wrapper">

					<div class="index-faq-content-wrapper">
						Each module is effected differently by development and we will always keep every version online so you never have to upgrade if you don't have

					<div class="index-faq-content-wrapper">
						No you do not have to use the updated release. You can always stay on your version and the blender is specifically built to cater for every version.
						However we encurrage you to assess the effort to upgrade as it may be minimal but enabling you to leverage off of the community fixes
						and testing that has already been done.

						As of version 2.0.0 we have rebuilt the GUI from scratch. It is completely custom build for your environment and enables us to be more flexible in
						its development. We tried to keep the classes and naming convention as close to Bootstrap 3.x as possible.

					<div class="index-faq-content-wrapper">
						With improved versioning in the release, project who are using a version of the GUI 1.x will continue to be able to use and implement their
						corresponding version. Each project should review the GUI 2.0.0 and assess the value, effort and impact of updating their projects before
						proceeding with the upgrade.
